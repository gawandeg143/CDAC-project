# CDAC-project
e-commerce application using J2EE + SpringBoot + Hibernate + JPA + HTML-5 + CSS3 + Bootstrap-4 + React.js + MySql 8.0

My Role in the project was of a Full Stack developer(build working on all the above tech stack)

VetPetShop is basically an e-commerce web application developed using above mentioned technologies. It is a platform where customer and sellers can buy and sell pets online. Also, customers can become sellers by subscribing to a temporary seller subscription and sell their pets on the platform. Basic features such as cart, payments, orders, sales for sellers, etc have been added.
I have added a short video so that we can have glimpse of the front end side of the project; also you can pull/download the repository -> extract and run on your systems for live demo.
